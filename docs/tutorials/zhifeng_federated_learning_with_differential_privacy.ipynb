    "\n",
    "This tutorial will demonstrate the recommended best practice for training models with user-level Differential Privacy using Tensorflow Federated. We will use the DP-SGD algorithm of [Abadi et al., \"Deep Learning with Differential Privacy\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) modified for user-level DP in a federated context in [McMahan et al., \"Learning Differentially Private Recurrent Language Models\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06963).\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely used method for bounding and quantifying the privacy leakage of sensitive data when performing learning tasks. Training a model with user-level DP guarantees that the model is unlikely to learn anything significant about the data of any individual, but can still (hopefully!) learn patterns that exist in the data of many clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train a model on the federated EMNIST dataset. There is an inherent trade-off between utility and privacy, and it may be difficult to train a model with high privacy that performs as well as a state-of-the-art non-private model. For expediency in this tutorial, we will train for just 100 rounds, sacrificing some quality in order to demonstrate how to train with high privacy. If we used more training rounds, we could certainly have a somewhat higher-accuracy private model, but not as high as a model trained without DP."

    "## Determine the noise sensitivity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get user-level DP guarantees, we must change the basic Federated Averaging algorithm in two ways. First, the clients' model updates must be clipped before transmission to the server, bounding the maximum influence of any one client. Second, the server must add enough noise to the sum of user updates before averaging to obscure the worst-case client influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clipping, we use the adaptive clipping method of [Andrew et al. 2021, Differentially Private Learning with Adaptive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03871), so no clipping norm needs to be explicitly set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding noise will in general degrade the utility of the model, but we can control the amount of noise in the average update at each round with two knobs: the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to the sum, and the number of clients in the average. Our strategy will be to first determine how much noise the model can tolerate with a relatively small number of clients per round with acceptable loss to model utility. Then to train the final model, we can increase the amount of noise in the sum, while proportionally scaling up the number of clients per round (assuming the dataset is large enough to support that many clients per round). This is unlikely to significantly affect model quality, since the only effect is to decrease variance due to client sampling (indeed we will verify that it does not in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we first train a series of models with 50 clients per round, with increasing amounts of noise. Specifically, we increase the \"noise_multiplier\" which is the ratio of the noise standard deviation to the clipping norm. Since we are using adaptive clipping, this means that the actual magnitude of the noise changes from round to round."
